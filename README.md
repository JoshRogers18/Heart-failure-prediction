| 1️⃣ [RStudio Code](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/R%20code.md)          | Helps set the ground work of giving a good idea what the data looks like and helps inform of data decisions to make while data mining.       |
| 2️⃣ [Orange Data Mining](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/Orange%20for%20Assignment%205.ows)    | Shows the architecture and set up of how I uploaded the data, cleansed it, applied multiple models, and looked at different accuracies.                     |
| 3️⃣ [Power BI presentation](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/Assignment%205.pbix) | Shows my presented slide show illustrating what I did from start to finish with the data, why it's important, and where it's from.           |

** In order to run the models in Power BI/Orange, you will need to change the path of the data to your own. The data is located above.
