| [RStudio Code](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/R%20code.md)          | Helps set the ground work of giving a good idea what the data looks like and helps inform of data decisions to make while data mining.       |
| [Orange Data Mining](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/Orange%20for%20Assignment%205.ows)    | Shows the architecture of how I took the data, cleansed it, applied multiple models, and looked at different accuracies.                     |
| [Power BI presentation](https://github.com/JoshRogers18/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/28ab7654a444276aa06ab352957b5becd63b7036/Assignment%205.pbix) | Shows my presented slide show illustrating what I did from start to finish with the data, why it's important, and where it's from.           |
